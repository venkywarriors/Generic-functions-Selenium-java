## Accessibility Testing <br> 
### Accessibility Testing is defined as a type of Software Testing performed to ensure that the application being tested is usable by people with disabilities like hearing, color blindness, old age and other disadvantaged groups. It is a subset of Usability Testing.<br>

### WCAG 2.2 Principles
The POUR guiding principles of WCAG 2.2 say that Web content must be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust (POUR) in order to be accessible to people with disabilities.
<details>
  <summary>Perceivable</summary>  
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.<br>
  
*1.1 – Text Alternatives*
- Do images have alternative text?

*1.2 – Time-based Media*
- Does video have captions and does audio have a transcript?

*1.3 – Adaptable*
- Does the web page or document include headings, lists, and other semantic elements to communicate document structure?
 
*1.4 – Distinguishable*
- Is the tab order and read order logical and intuitive?
- Do form fields within web pages and documents have appropriately coded labels and prompts?
- Have you avoided using visual characteristics to communicate information (e.g., “click the circle on the right” or “required fields are in red”)?
- Does the interface have sufficient contrast between text color and background color?
- Does the content scale well when page is zoomed?
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Operable</summary>   
User interface components and navigation must be operable.
 
 *2.1 – Keyboard Accessible*
- Can all menus, links, buttons, and other controls be operated by keyboard, to make them accessible to users who are unable to use a mouse?
- Does the web page include a visible focus indicator so all users, especially those using a keyboard, can easily track their current position?

*2.2 – Enough Time*
- Does your site have a slideshow? If so, please reconsider.
- Do features that scroll or update automatically (e.g., slideshows, carousels) have prominent accessible controls that enable users to pause or advance these features on their own?
- Do pages that have time limits include mechanisms for adjusting those limits for users who need more time?

*2.3 – Seizures*
- Have you avoided using content that flashes or flickers?

*2.4 – Navigable*
- Does the web page or document have a title that describes its topic or purpose?
- Are mechanisms in place that allow users to bypass blocks of content (e.g., a “skip to main content” link on a web page or bookmarks in a PDF)?
- Does the website include two or more ways of finding content, such as a navigation menu, search feature, or site map?
- Is link text meaningful, independent of context?
<p>All functional elements in Web content that operate with a mouse must also operate with a keyboard.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Understandable</summary>  
Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable
  
*3.1 – Readable*
- Has the language of the web page or document been defined?
  
*3.2 – Predictable*
- Have you avoided links, controls, or form fields that automatically trigger a change in context?
- Does the website include consistent and persistent navigation?
  
*3.3 – Input Assistance*
- Do online forms provide helpful, accessible error and verification messages?
<p>Use simple, consistent, predictable navigation elements throughout a website.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Robust</summary> 
Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
  
*4.1 – Compatible*
- Is the web page coded using valid HTML?
- Do rich, dynamic, web interfaces, such as modal windows, drop-down menus, slideshows, and carousels, include ARIA markup?
<p>This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)</p>

## The main difference between the different WCAG versions lies in the number of new success criteria:

WCAG 2.0 has 61 success criteria<br>
WCAG 2.1 has 78 (61 + 17 new success criteria)<br>
WCAG 2.2 will have 87 (78 + 9 new success criteria)<br>

## WCAG 2.0 Conformance Levels<br> 
**Conformance Level:** One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.<br>
**Level A:** For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the Web page satisfies all the Level A Success Criteria, or a conforming alternate version is provided.<br>
**Level AA:** For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.<br>
**Level AAA:** For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.<br>

## How many total WCAG success criteria are there?<br> 
There are a total of <b>61 </b>WCAG 2.0 success criteria, and a total of <b>78</b> WCAG 2.1 success criteria (not including conformance criteria). WCAG 2.0 is a subset of WCAG 2.1, meaning that all 61 WCAG 2.0 guidelines are a part of WCAG 2.1. WCAG 2.1 adds 17 new success criteria.<br>

View [`a11y Checklist`](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/):spiral_notepad:<br>
### :pushpin: Keyboard only operation
- [x] Check focus (tab) order
- [x]  check visual indication of keyboard focus (make more visual)
- [x] any keyboard traps?
- [x] does any hidden content get focus?
- [x] does anything which is mous-operable not get keyboard focus?
- [x] are there any custom controls or widgets which cannot be operated with keyboard-only use?
### :pushpin: Activate Assistive Tech
- [x] activate the AT you are testing with before opening the program or browser
- [x] Open the program or the browser and website you are testing
  - IE11/JAWS
  - NVDA/Firefox (pre quantum updates)
  - VoiceOver/Safari
- [x] Use the AT to access the feature or page to be tested
  - try not to use the mouse - no errors, but bad testing habits
### :pushpin: Visual Testing with a screen reader
- [x] Using JAWS on a webpage in IE11
  - use down arrow key to read through the page
  - order matches visual order
  - anything skipped
  - anything read which isn't visible
- [x] Use tab key and shift- [x]tab to read through the page
  - only controls receive focus
  - anything skipped
  - can every link button and custom control be operated
  - does the announced role match the result
  - does a link go somewhere or does it open a dialog
- [x] Shortcuts
  - Insert-F6 to see struct of headings
  - Insert-F7 to see a list of links (check for meaning in context or in list)
  - 'L' key to see order of lists
  - 'F' key to see order from form fields (Insert-F5)
  - 'T' key to see order of tables 
### :pushpin: Image Testing
- [x] Inspect all images for "alt" attributes
  - if no alt, usually will read file name
- [x] which images are purely decorative
  - remove colors (IE a11y tools) - is the message being indicated by color alone? (red for error)
  - determine if color is an indicator
- [x] both colorblind and screenreader
- [x] looking at the page is info indicated with styling (bold italic shading etc)
### :pushpin: Font and background color testing
- [x] change text and background colors in browser, is everything that is informative still visible?
  - test high contrast modes
- [x] Exit responsive design view, reduce size to default and activate color contrast checker (level access tool)
### :pushpin: Enlarging Text
- [x] Increase size to 200% open responsive design view (ctrl-shift-m in firefox), and sclae down to 1366x768 (most common screen size)
- [x] Does text wrap properly
- [x] wcag requires up to 200% ******
- [x] is any feature lost / hidden?
- [x] does text blur as it's larger? - possibly yes bc it's an image and not actual text
### :pushpin: CSS Testing
Testing the Information provided and the CSS relationship
- [x] Remove CSS
  - in firefox go to view > page style > no style to remove css
  - view dom order on screen
### :pushpin: Visual Aria Testing
- [x] If the product uses ARIA
  - Use the visual ARIA bookmarklet
- [x] Tab through all custom widgets, open menus, etc
- [x] Example Normal view vs Example ARIA bookmarklet view
### :pushpin: Automated Testing
- [x] run automated web accessibility tests, using one of the number of different tools
- [x] cross-references those results with the ones from manual testing
- [x] remove duplication and check for false positives

## JAWS Screen Reader
JAWS is a popular screen reader for Windows computer. This article is designed to help users who are new to JAWS learn the basic controls for testing web content, and to serve as a reference for the occasional JAWS user.
